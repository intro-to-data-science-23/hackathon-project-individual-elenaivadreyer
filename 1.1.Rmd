## Interactive map of survey entries
Create an interactive leaflet map divided by states that are colored in relation to a total number of survey responses across all waves, following good practice of visualization. For this plot, you should:
- employ a color palette based on the number range of survey entries.
- use the OpenStreetMap.Mapnik provider tile.
- create a popup that reads “Total survey responses for {State initials}: {Number}”.
- add a color legend with a title.

```{r}
meof_usa_survey_df = readRDS('survey/meof_usa_survey_df.RDS')
meof_usa_web_df = readRDS('tracking/meof_usa_web_df.RDS')
time_zones = readRDS('tracking/time_zones.RDS')

# meof_usa_survey_wave3 = filter(meof_usa_survey_df, wave == 3)
```
